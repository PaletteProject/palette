## Requirements

### Docker

Palette runs in a Docker container, providing the necessary Node environment. Make sure you have the following
installed:

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Check your installations with:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

### Canvas API Token

A token is required to interact with the Canvas API.

#### Generating a personal token:

- Sign in to Canvas
- On the left sidebar menu click the account widget
- Click `Settings`
- Scroll down to `Approved Integrations`
- Select `+ New Access Token`
- Label your token by filling in the `Purpose` field
- Set an expiration date and/or time as desired, leave blank for no expiration.
- Copy the full token before refreshing the page.

#### Using your Canvas token with Palette:

- In the top right of the application, click on the gray circle to open a drop-down menu
- Select `Settings`
- Paste your full Canvas API token into the `Token Input` field
- Select `Update Settings`
- Navigate to the `Builder` tab if you want to create or edit rubrics or the `Grading` tab to grade assignment
  submissions.
- Select your target course and assignment.
- Have a blast!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your account must be authorized as a teacher or grader in order to perform most actions. Students can do certain
> actions via the API but Palette does not support those at this time.

## Startup Instructions - Easy

Two scripts have been provided to update and run the application without worrying about Docker commands.

### Update and Run

From the project root, run `./update.sh` to pull the latest content from GitHub, shutdown any running instances of
the application in Docker, rebuild the container with the latest changes, and start the container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run this script if there's a new update to pull. If the application has any errors, try running this first as
> Docker caching sometimes causes issues.

### Run

When you just want to run the application, this is the fastest method.

Run `./start.sh` from the project root to start the container and run Palette.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the application has any errors, try running `update.sh` first as Docker caching can sometimes cause issues.

###

## Startup Instructions - Advanced

### Option 1: Running with Docker

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root folder:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd palette
   ```

2. Run one of the following commands to start the services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up        # Attached mode
   docker-compose up -d     # Detached mode
   ```

   This will build and start the container on any OS.

3. **Stopping the Containers**
    - Use `CTRL + C` if in attached mode or `docker-compose down` if detached.

### Option 2: Running without Docker

If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 18+) installed:

1. After cloning the repo, run:

   ```bash
   npm install && npm run dev
   ```

---

## Shutting Down

### Stopping Containers

- To stop services and remove containers:

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **Removing Volumes and Images**  
  For a complete cleanup:

  ```bash
  docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all
  ```

- **Optional:**  
  To remove unused resources:
  ```bash
  docker system prune --all --volumes
  ```

---

## Usage

Once up and running, you can interact with the application on http://localhost:5173.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Permissions Issues**  
   Ensure Docker is running, and check that your user is in the `docker` group. For persistent issues, run with `sudo`.

2. **Checking Logs**

   ```bash
   docker-compose logs
   ```

3. **Rebuild Containers**  
   After changes:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Network Issues**  
   Verify port `5173` is free.
